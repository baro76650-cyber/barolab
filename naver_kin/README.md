# KnowledgeIn alternating-account experiment

The user-approved trial now runs **2026-10-15 through 2026-10-21 KST**.
Read-only measurement continues through **2026-10-24**. The two authorized accounts
are `adinfo0905` and `stone0747`; their existing dedicated CDP browsers must already
be running. The scheduler never starts or stops browsers automatically. Closed
browsers block that operating round rather than triggering a direct Chrome launch.

## Completion-based cadence

Windows checks conditions every five minutes. This does **not** mean publishing
every five minutes. After one genuine operating round finishes, the entire system
waits at least 60 minutes before starting the next account. Accounts alternate;
a suspended account or exhausted account cap is skipped in favor of an available
account. The global cooldown survives midnight and process restarts.

A round includes discovery, source capture, model writing, independent review,
publication if approved, public verification, and its measurement update. Review
rejections, no suitable questions, and connection/login errors still finish a round
and start its cooldown. A no-op condition check does not change the cooldown,
account turn, or operating budget and does not query GA4.

Submission limits remain **ten attempts globally and five per account per KST day**.
There is an additional model-usage budget of **ten operating rounds globally and
five per account daily**, including unsuccessful/rejected rounds. The existing
manual pilot publication counts toward today's operating and submission limits.
Thus ten is an upper limit, not a promise of ten successful answers.

Private SQLite `operating_cadence` holds the last completion, last account, and one
durable in-flight reservation. Reservation, account selection and operating caps
are checked with `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`. The final pre-submit gate rechecks the exact
reservation/question/account, live enable setting, service suspension, trial date,
current KST attribution date and submission caps atomically. Manual sends without
the same reservation cannot bypass the interval. Question IDs remain globally unique.

The initial completion anchor is taken once from the latest genuine recorded
publication; no-post authoring exercises are excluded. Later verification refreshes
do not change that anchor. If a process dies mid-round, the next owner marks it
interrupted/unknown and waits another hour from recovery. Previously uncertain
submissions are never automatically reposted. There is no burst catch-up.

The model is explicitly `gpt-6.1-sol` in this KnowledgeIn-only configuration, using
the existing authenticated ChatGPT subscription through `common.codex_cli`.
Global model settings are unchanged. FreeLLMAPI and provider fallbacks are prohibited.
Questions and source pages remain untrusted data. Every automatic answer requires a
separate evidence review and deterministic URL/source/account binding checks. Existing
manual drafts are preserved. Only the selected question is claimed; search counts may
contain repeats and are not represented as unique selected questions.

## Windows tasks and operations

`python -m naver_kin.scheduler --configure --model gpt-6.1-sol --start-date 2026-10-15`
prepares a disabled configuration. After supervisor implementation review,
`--register` replaces only this workflow's owned tasks with one five-minute condition
trigger and the separate daily 20:30 measurement task. Task names remain
`BaroLab-Kin-Seven-Day-Pilot` and `BaroLab-Kin-Seven-Day-Pilot-Measurement`.
Publication ends on October 21, measurement on October 24. Date/enable guards
also apply at the last moment before clicking; a long generation cannot extend the
trial or silently use yesterday's attribution date after midnight.

`--status` reads actual task registration, enable state, next run and last result.
`--tick --dry-run` observes cadence without generating, reserving, submitting or
advancing a turn. `--authoring-dry-run --account adinfo0905` exercises actual
research/writing/review only and leaves private artifacts, never an operating claim.
The ordinary tick starts at most one round and has no inline repeated-send loop.

The scheduler lock serializes operations; the existing blog lock is only probed and
released before work, and each real browser transaction owns that blog lock itself.
A busy blog is not a completed operating round. Explicit account protection or CAPTCHA
halts the account; question-specific refusal skips only that question. No recovery
or CAPTCHA bypass is attempted.

Measurements use existing GA4 access, with unknown revenue remaining unknown.
Public retention checks cover up to 100 initially verified answers with bounded
requests and a ten-minute budget. An unavailable check is unknown and never erases
the original verification history. Condition-only ticks do not repeatedly collect GA4.

Execution uses local Python and the absolute UNC script path, not mapped drive Y:.
It requires the existing logged-in Windows session and both dedicated account
browsers. Locking the screen preserves the session; signing out, powering off or
closing browsers prevents work. Logs: `server/data/kin-scheduler.log` and private
`kin-scheduler-errors.log`. Configuration/state: `kin-automation.json` and
`kin-automation-state.json`; ledger: `server/data/kin.sqlite3`; public snapshot:
`dashboard/data/kin.json`.

## Manual reviewed answer

1. Discover a narrow topic matched to an existing public article:
   `python -m naver_kin.pipeline --account adinfo0905 --discover --keyword "세탁기 배수 필터"`
   Discovery reserves question IDs globally and updates the dashboard snapshot.
   Check question recency, relevance, existing answers, duplicate publications,
   and the actual logged-in account before selecting a question. Discovery is not
   permission to answer irrelevant questions or reuse the same answer repeatedly.
   Skip questions without a directly relevant, already verified owned guide;
   do not force a destination link or invent service guarantees.
2. Save the browser's captured question JSON privately with `question_url`, `title`,
   `body`, and `captured_at`. Write a substantive standalone answer in a private
   text file, with exactly one `{OUTBOUND_URL}` placeholder for the relevant owned
   article. Include an accurate indication that the linked article is operated by
   the answerer. Do not invent experience, expertise, results, or eligibility.
3. Prepare source evidence and the exact attribution URL:
   `python -m naver_kin.pipeline --account adinfo0905 --prepare --question-json PRIVATE/question.json --article-url https://www.must-good.com/washing-machine-drain-filter-cleaning --answer-file PRIVATE/answer.txt --output PRIVATE/draft.json`
   Use a private directory outside `dashboard`; drafts contain full source bodies.
4. Supervisor checks the captured question, source accuracy, freshness, standalone
   usefulness, affiliation disclosure, and actual linked destination. Only after
   approving that exact content, set `review.approved` to `true` and `review.reviewer`
   to the reviewer identity. Preserve `review.binding`; edits require preparation
   and review again. Import with:
   `python -m naver_kin.pipeline --account adinfo0905 --import-draft PRIVATE/draft.json`
5. The operating scheduler starts the exact reviewed attempt under its active reservation (do not invent or reuse a reservation ID):
   `python -m naver_kin.pipeline --account adinfo0905 --run-once --run-id ACTIVE_RESERVATION_ID`
   Add `--question-id QUESTION_ID` to select the exact reviewed candidate when
   other unapproved drafts are retained in the queue.
   One answer maximum per invocation; the same global ten/account five daily limits
   and authorized experiment dates apply. The reviewed article is fetched again.
6. Verify public publication separately:
   `python -m naver_kin.pipeline --account adinfo0905 --verify QUESTION_ID`
   Exact account, question, answer ID, body, and outbound URL must match in public
   evidence. Login-session visibility alone is insufficient.

`--status` refreshes sanitized `dashboard/data/kin.json`. Private ledger:
`server/data/kin.sqlite3`; per-account locks: `server/data/kin-ACCOUNT.lock`.
The global question key prevents the second account answering the same question.
State is saved as `publishing` immediately before the final click, then remains
`submitted_unverified` until independently verified. A crash, CAPTCHA, moderation,
timeout, or ambiguous outcome after that boundary never permits automatic repost.
Check the existing publication and reconcile evidence instead.

Published answers, referral visits, and revenue are separate measurements.
Inbound visits and attributed revenue remain `null`/`unmeasured` in this pilot
snapshot. Existing GA4 reporting can subsequently report qualified `naver_kin`
referrals, but those do not by themselves establish human visits or incremental
revenue. No new collector or API server deployment is required for the snapshot.

Tests: `python -m unittest naver_kin.test_pipeline`.
